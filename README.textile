h1. Listlist

Listlist is a mailing list management system which relies on gentle anarchy, allowing every registered user to create/update/delete lists.

h2. More Information

User-facing is the list management. It also sends emails.

h2. Dependencies

To develop this application and run all the specs locally, you will need:

* rvm
* postgresql
* redis

(If you want to run all the specs without starting redis, you can run
@rake spec:noredis@
)

h3. Setting up PostgreSQL

I don't know about you, but I rarely ever set up rails apps with postgres, so I always forget how to make it work. Here it is, for next time. Change the password to what you really want it to be. hunter2 is a reference to (bash.org)[http://www.bash.org/?244321].

bq. $ psql -U #{someadminuser} postgres
postgres=> CREATE USER listlist WITH PASSWORD 'hunter2';
postgres=> ALTER ROLE listlist WITH CREATEDB;
postgres=> \q
$ psql -U listlist postgres
postgres=> CREATE DATABASE listlist_development;
postgres=> \q

I hope that helps. It sure as hell will help me.

h3. Running in development mode

If you want to get the archives going, right now, you need a resque worker in dev mode. Ergo:

    $ rake resque:work

h3. Running with coverage

Coverage will be enabled if you set the COV environment variable to ... Something. Ergo:

    $ COV=1 rake spec
    $ COV=true rake spec

Both will work.

h3. Clearing the cache

You may run into issues parsing some emails. Or something. There are two options:

1) Delete the tmp directory
2) From the rails console, run Rails.cache.clear


h2. Installing the Application

The production application is hosted on Heroku. Check DEPLOY.textile for deployment details.

h2. Getting Started

All settings are managed by the rails_config gem. Most of the values are bogus but should be ok for dev and testing.

User accounts are automatically created when logging in for the first time using a gmail account.  You can use another google apps domain by changing the 'organization_domain' setting.

When you login, you'll see a list of mailing lists. You can reorder them,
edit them, join one, leave one, create one, delete one.
And then you can send emails to those lists.

h3. Deleting an Email Address from All Lists

Use the 'Remove user' link on the ListList home page to remove a user from all
lists, and from the database.
